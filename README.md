## üöÄ Project Overview

**Stellar Sharks** is a cutting-edge web application that visualizes the dynamic marine ecosystem to predict shark presence and behavior. Using environmental factors like **chlorophyll**, **phytoplankton concentration**, and **temperature**, users can interact with **maps, graphs, and charts** to explore ocean health and track sharks through a highly intuitive web interface.

### Key Features

#### Explore Habitat Dashboard
- Interactive ocean map highlighting **shark hotspots**.
- **Layer toggle** for chlorophyll, phytoplankton, temperature, and other environmental parameters.
- **Charts** showing spatial distribution of chlorophyll and phytoplankton concentrations.
- **Graphs** presenting time-based predictions of shark activity.

#### Smart Tag Concept
- Future-oriented electronics device for **live shark tracking**.
- Monitors shark feeding, movement, and surroundings in real-time.
- Conceptual model designed for **enhanced wildlife monitoring**.

#### Safety Guide
- Comprehensive guide for **shark safety** in marine environments.
- Provides **alerts** when sharks are likely to be nearby.
- Instructions on how to **avoid attacks** and ensure safety underwater.

#### About Section
- Detailed explanation of the project, data sources, and scientific methodology.
- Highlights the integration of **NASA satellite data** and predictive analytics.

## üó∫Ô∏è How It Works

### Data Acquisition
- Utilizes **NASA satellite datasets** for ocean temperature, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton.
- Aggregates real-time oceanographic data to generate accurate habitat predictions.

### Hotspot Prediction
- Areas with high chlorophyll and phytoplankton concentration and suitable temperature are marked as **potential shark habitats**.
- These **hotspots** are displayed dynamically on the map with corresponding charts.

### Visualizations
- **Interactive Map:** Toggle environmental layers to see correlations with shark presence.
- **Charts:** Display spatial distribution of key parameters.
- **Graphs:** Show time-series prediction of shark activity for research and monitoring.

### Smart Tag Tracking (Concept)
- Future device model provides **real-time shark tracking**.
- Enables data collection on shark behavior, feeding patterns, and environmental interactions.
